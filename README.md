### [Time Series Predictive Modeling <br> Online Retail Data](https://kimberlyahealy.github.io/TimeSeries_OnlineRetailData/)

> The data ([OnlineRetail.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)) come from all transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retail store. The company sells unique gifts and the majority of customers are wholesalers. This report will use techniques to explore the data and use three different time series algorithms to model sales. The conclusion states which model(s) best predict sales and recommendations for further analysis.     
>        
> The following predictive models are used:        
>  - **Model 1: Simple Moving Average**: a weighted average function that identifies the previous pattern in the data and uses that pattern to predict future data points.      
>  - **Model 2: Exponential Smoothing**: similar to Simple Moving Average, but contains a smoothing constant which can be tweaked for more responsive or more stable models.      
>  - **Model 3: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)**: unlilke the previous models, ARIMA considers the correlations among the previous values of the time series to predict future values.    
>         
>          
> The following question is answered:     
>  - **Which time series model best predicts company sales?**

### [Linear Regression Predictive Modeling <br> 2018 Customer Data](https://kimberlyahealy.github.io/Regression_2018SalesData/)

> The data (customer_data_2018.csv) come from the 2018 sales of a small wholesale business. The variables in the raw data set include:   
>    
> Variable       |   Type      |    Meaning
> ---------------|-------------|------------------------------------------
> Customer.id    |    integer  |    Unique customer ID
> State          |    string   |    State customer operates in
> Last.yr.sales  |    numeric  |    2018 sales amount
> Prior.yr.sales |    numeric  |    2017 sales amount
> Life.orders    |    numeric  |    Total amount of sales from customer over the lifetime of the relationship
> Entry.date     |    date     |    Date the customer made a first purchase
> Cust.type.id   |    string   |    Descriptive word to describe customer's business type
>   
>   
> The following models are used:        
>   - **Simple Linear Regression**: a model that estimates the relationship between two continuous variables (one dependent and one independent) using a straight line.    
>   - **Multiple Linear Regression**: a model that estimates the relationship between one dependent and two or more independent continuous variables using a straight line.      
>          
> The following question is answered:     
>   - **Which regression model best predicts company sales?**

## [Performance Analysis, Trends & Recommendations <br> Digital Media Ad Campaign Data](https://kimberlyahealy.github.io/Trends_DigitalMediaAdCampaign/)

> The data (DigitalMediaCampaign.xlsx) come from a digital campaign that included banners, digital video, and rich media advertisements. This report provides insight into the campaign performance.     
>       
> The following KPIs are investigated:    
>  - **Clicks**: The number of times the ad is clicked     
>  - **Click-Thru-Rate**: The rate which impressions drive clicks (Clicks / Impressions)   
>  - **Completion Rate**: The rate which video impressions are viewed (Completes / Impressions)    
>  - **Engagement Rate**: The rate which rich media is engaged with (Interactions / Impressions)       
>          
>          
> The following questions are answered:     
>   - **How does the performance of the ads differ by Site, Device, or Creative Name?** (PARTS V-VII)       
>   - **Are there any trends in KPI performance over time?** (PART VIII)       
>   - **What recommendations would you make? What other KPIs would you consider?** (PART IX)
